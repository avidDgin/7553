How to Use:
1. Download or clone git repository to get all the files on your local machine
2. Open Powershell (Windows Key + R and type in powershell) and navigate to where you downloaded the files within the terminal
3. Run this code "flask --app main --debug run
4. Copy and paste (or type) the IP address that is given in the terminal into the search bar on your browser
5. Take your desired wav file and navigate through windows explorer to where you saved the files and put it in the static/wavFiles directory and change the name to convert.wav
7. Use Navigation bar to convert given song to an image
8. Click on filters to see the image and put an image filter on it

Future Work: Currently user interaction is limited to converting a given wav file from the wavFiles folder to an image and not an uploaded one from the user.
Ideally that will be implemented on the homepage and take user input and they can upload any song they like.  We would also like to reverse the conversion and
be able to take a user given image and implement that into a song.
